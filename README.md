BIP39 Seed Phrase Mnemonics Generator – offline & online tool
Mnemonic code converter.
Easily create your own BIP39 compatible seed phrase (mnemonic)
This tool will allow you to easily create your own BIP39 compatible seed phrase (mnemonic)
with cryptographically secure random number generator.

You can think of this tool as a hardware or software wallet opened up where you can tinker with stuff inside and do everything manually.

Possible use cases
Randomly compute a seed phrase safely if you need to. Generate 12 or 24 words seed phrase, and other lengths.
Check if your seed phrase is correct (you will receive a notification if a given word is not from the list.
You can check all your individual addresses without a wallet, if you would need that.
Compute your coins addresses plus private keys so you could retrieve funds manually by using Bip44 standard or other. Could be useful if you lose your wallet and are unable to get one.
Create a new bip39/44 wallet to create a coin address and transfer your coins ASAP, then later input the seed in a wallet and restore. Could be useful in a bad case of a compromised wallet.
Generate some truly random seed phrase with your own entropy source if you would like, for example, you can roll your own dice yourself.
See how things work inside your hardware or software wallet. It is easy to see here that your seed phrase is also an instruction set for setting up addresses and private keys (i.e. Bip44). You can see how keys and addresses are computed from the seed.
Advanced mode features
convert mnemonic code to seed (mnemonic code converter),
calculate derivation paths/addresses from mnemonics,
use your own entropy to create seed phrase.
